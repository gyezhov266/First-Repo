# First-Repo
1. Planning and Preparation:

a. Understand the current infrastructure: Before starting the migration, it is essential to understand the current infrastructure, including the number of EC2 instances, their instance types, storage configurations, network layout, and security settings.

b. Determine the target architecture: Plan the new Docker containerized infrastructure, considering factors like the desired level of scalability, performance, and security. Decide on the Docker image and container runtime to use, as well as the networking and storage configurations.

c. Prepare the development environment: Set up a local development environment that mirrors the production environment to test and validate the migration process. This should include installing Docker, Docker Compose, or other tools needed for containerization.

d. Create a detailed migration plan: Develop a step-by-step plan that outlines the migration process, timelines, and resources required. The plan should also include rollback procedures in case of any issues during the migration process.

2. Backup and Secure Data:

a. Take snapshots of the current EC2 instances: Create snapshots of the root volumes and data volumes attached to the EC2 instances to ensure that the data is safe and can be restored if necessary.

b. Secure data at rest: Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) encryption for this purpose.

3. Build the Base Image:

a. Base Image: .

NOTE: (Currently having issues ssh-ing into my EC2 instances, looking into it)

4. Write a Dockerfile that defines the instructions for building the Splunk container image. The Dockerfile should specify the base image, install any additional dependencies, and copy configuration files as needed.

5. Build Image and push to Artifactory and ECR (to make the image available for deployment on EC2 instances)

6. Set up topology that allows the containers to communicate with each other and external services. VPC/ELB/Route 53 for this purpose.

7.  Use ECS to deploy the Splunk containers across multiple instances. Each container should have access to the shared storage where the data is stored.

8. Configure persistent storage for the containers by using Amazon EFS, Amazon EBS, or another distributed file system that can be mounted within the containers. Make sure the storage solution is accessible by all nodes in the cluster.

9. Configure Splunk to work with the new containerized infrastructure. This includes updating the Splunk configuration files to point to the correct storage locations and networks.

10. Test to ensure the migrated Splunk cluster functions correctly. Validate functionality, performance, and security of new Splunk setup.

11. Monitor the containerized Splunk cluster closely to identify any performance or scaling issues with CloudWatch to track metrics and adjust the cluster configuration as needed.

12. Update and Maintain:

a. Keep the Splunk software up-to-date by applying patches and updates regularly.

b. Regularly update the Docker images and container configurations for security/performance optimizations.
